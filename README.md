### About Me
---
I spent the last 4 years teaching high school math in Oklahoma City and Chicago. When the pandemic started, I found myself trying to learn to code to start creating tools my students could use during remote learning. Along the way, I discovered a passion for the field. I am excited to now be pursuing software engineering as a full time career. 

Right now, I am working on building out SuccessAbility, a fullstack application to support educations and their students with diverse learning needs.
